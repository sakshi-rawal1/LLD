NVT >> Noun Verb Technique

Has-a Relationship
Composition >> Customer <>----has-a---- Adhar Card >> Adhar card cannot exist without a customer so its a composition //diamond is black
Aggregation >> Cart <>----has-a-----Item >> the item exists independetly even if it get expires or its not added to card and bought in future. // diamond is white 

Is-a Relationship (Inheritance)
Lesson---is-a---- Cooking Lesson 
Lesson---is-a---- Driving Lesson 

SRP >> Single Responsibility Principle 
(a class, a package, source code) Module >> Only 1 actor can change this

In inhertance (is-a relationship)
as we go downwards it becomes more specialized 
as we move upwards it becomes more generalized 

LSP >> Liskov Substitution Principle 
1. check if the derived class is actually is-a type of parent class
2. check if we can subsitute the instance of child class with parent class 
3. the methods in parent class should hold relavent for all the derived classes

ISP >> Interface Segregation Principle 

SOLID >> Dependency Inversion 

Priciple of DI != Application of DI //DI >> Dependency Inversion 


Dependency Injection
Inversion Control 

Every Design pattern has a 
1. Name
2. Problem with a certain pattern
3. Solution 
4. Consequence

>>Patterns are designed to use interfaces
>>Patterns favours aggregation over inheritance
Aggregation means a collection of things that are not part of it>> airport <>---has-a---aeroplane (independent) //white diamond
Composition means something is a part of another thing >> aeroplane<>---has-a----wheel (dependent) //black diamond

Code Smells to avoid 
1. Long Methods
2. Code Duplication
3. Misleading Names
4. Obvious comments
5. Magic Numbers
6. One-letter variable name
7. Commented code
8. dead code
9. rigidity - difficult to change >> a single changes causes cascade of subsequent changes in dependent modules (tight coupling)
10. fragility - a small change can break the system in many places with no obvious relation to the place where changes are made
11. immobility - cannot be reused outside the system 
12. over design creates complexity
